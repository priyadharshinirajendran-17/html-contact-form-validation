# Contact Form with HTML Validation

## About
This task focuses on creating a contact form using HTML and CSS with built-in HTML5 validation.
The main objective is to understand client-side validation without using JavaScript.

## What I Did

- Used proper input types such as text, email, and tel
- Applied HTML5 validation attributes like required, pattern, and maxlength
- Added labels for each input to improve accessibility
- Styled the form using external CSS for a clean layout

## Validation Used
- required to ensure fields are not left empty
- email input type for valid email format
- pattern attribute to allow only a 10-digit phone number
- maxlength to limit user input length

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- VS Code

## Learning Outcome
Through this task, I learned how browser-based validation works, why form validation is important,
and how to create clean and accessible forms without JavaScript.
